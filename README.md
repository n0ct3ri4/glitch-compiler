# Glitch Compiler

> `Glitch is a NodeJS-based compilable programming langage.`

## But why ??

Because programming in NodeJS with another syntax can be a very good experience.

## WARNING !!

I don't want to maintain this langage up-to-date, because this is a reform of another version I made few month ago, just for fun. So, if you want to own the project, contact me via this E-Mail address : `contact@wlvs.fr`.
